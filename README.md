## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing MSc in Data Science at Christ University.
- ðŸŒ± I'm enthusiastic about machine learning, data analysis, and solving real-world problems.
- ðŸ“š Always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest trends in the field of data science.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection]

I orchestrated the development of an AI-powered diabetic retinopathy detection system. Leveraging deep learning techniques
â€¢ Uses the CNN model to extract features from the images. Then used the features to predict Diabetic Retinopathy using machine learning algorithms
â€¢ The project achieved an impressive 92% accuracy rate in classifying retinal images, effectively assisting medical professionals in early disease identification.
â€¢ I enabled the reduction of false negatives by 27%, showcasing my dedication to impactful technological solutions.
